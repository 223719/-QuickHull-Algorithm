 QuickHull Algorithm
Definition: QuickHull is a computational geometry algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points in a 2D plane.
Purpose: The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the given points.
Significance: Understanding the convex hull is essential in various fields like computer graphics, image processing, and geographic information systems.

 Problem Solved by QuickHull

Convex Hull Problem: Finding the outer boundary of a set of points such that the boundary forms the smallest possible convex polygon.
Importance: The convex hull provides a simple representation of the shape and extent of a point set.


 Practical Applications of QuickHull

Computer Graphics: Used for rendering and collision detection by determining the outermost boundaries of objects.
Image Processing: Helps in object recognition by identifying the boundary of shapes in images.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Used to define the boundaries of geographic regions.
Robotics: Assists in path planning and obstacle avoidance by identifying the edges of obstacles.
Pattern Recognition: Helps in identifying and classifying shapes in data analysis.

How QuickHull Algorithm Works

Step-by-Step Process:
Initial Points Selection: Find the leftmost and rightmost points, A and B.
Divide Points: Split the remaining points into two subsets, one above and one below the line AB.
Find Farthest Point: For each subset, find the point furthest from AB, denoted as P.
Recursive Subdivision: Recursively apply the above steps to the subsets formed by AP and PB.
Combine Results: Combine all the identified points to form the convex hull.


Analysis of QuickHull Algorithm

Time Complexity: Average-case time complexity is ùëÇ(ùëõlogùëõ), but worst-case can be ùëÇ(ùëõ2).
Space Complexity: The algorithm uses ùëÇ(ùëõ)
O(n) space for storing points and recursion stack.
Suitability:
Efficiency: Suitable for moderate-sized datasets.
Scalability: May face performance issues with very large datasets due to worst-case complexity.
Comparison: Often compared with other convex hull algorithms like Graham's scan and Jarvis March, with QuickHull being faster on average but not the best in worst-case scenarios.
